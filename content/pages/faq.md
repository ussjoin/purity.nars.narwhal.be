* **What is this?**
  * A purity test. Remember [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/90s/comments/rurc28/does_anybody_else_remember_taking_the_purity_test/) or similar? Or have you come across [this Slate article](https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/02/the-spark-purity-test-shaped-millennials-understanding-of-sex-so-we-reimagined-it-for-2018.html)? It's vaguely in that mold.
* **But I thought NARS was generally against the concept of "ham radio purity," that being the thing that keeps the hobby old, white, cis, male, and hetero.**
  * Yes.
* **How should I regard this, then?**
  * We suggest as any of
    * A TODO list;
    * A performative shitpost;
    * A NARS incarnation of "I remember growing up in the 90s!"; or
    * An amusing site on the vast Internet.
* **So really the idea is to have done as many of these things as possible?**
  * Yes, exactly like the old purity tests.
* **Wait, a TODO list?**
  * Yes. Did this purity test spark your interest in trying a new mode, a new operating tactic, or a new band? That's awesome! We will soon have achievement certificates you can generate for individual items, too.
* **Can I see how "pure" I am compared to others?**
  * No! We collect no data from this at all; everything runs in your browser (including generating the certificate), so we don't have any way to get cohort data like that. We suggest sharing your scores with your friends manually (again, in the mode of the old purity tests).
* **What happens if I get them all?**
  * Then you are the most epic ham person, and you should both feel proud and share joy in RF with others!
* **Are questions being added?**
  * Yes, all the time; you're welcome to suggest more, either via [email](mailto:nars@narwhal.be) or by opening a pull request [at our GitHub repo](https://github.com/ussjoin/purity.nars.narwhal.be/blob/main/assets/purityquestions.json).
