Very much a draft; not to be taken as a finished product. How did you find this?

## TODO

- [ ] A tiny note at the top of the page that explains that if your JS is disabled, you are missing no content, but won't be able to get a score or a certificate because those are done in JS. (Disappear it with JS of course)
- [ ] Remove bullets from subquestions
- [ ] Break questions into categories (enhance JSON data model)
- [ ] Points scoring (including custom points on a per-question basis)
- [ ] Take testtaker's callsign/name down (to use on certificate)
- [ ] Render Markdown in the questions (so they can contain links, _emphasis_, etc)
- [ ] PDF generation (for certificates) using [jsPDF](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF)
